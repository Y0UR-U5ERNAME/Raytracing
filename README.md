# Raytracing

A basic raytracing demo made with pygame (very slow). Requirements: Python 3, pygame, numpy. Based on Sebastian Lague's [raytacing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0KTGYJtUk).

Change the `shapes` variable in rtools.py to change the shapes that are displayed. Supported shapes are spheres and triangles.
